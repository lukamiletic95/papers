	<h4>Figure # - Mempool transaction gossiping in Tendermint</h4>
</div>

* *T - Transaction request*

Let us assume that a *C* node wants to have its transaction *T* processed by the Tendermint network, in a way explained earlier in the text.

Current Tendermint Mempool gossiping algorithm works as follows:

	1. When a FN receives a transaction T, it stores it inside its own Mempool.
	2.
