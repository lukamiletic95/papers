* *T - Transaction request*

Let us assume that a *C* node wants to have its transaction *T* processed by the Tendermint network, in a way explained earlier in the text.

Current Tendermint Mempool gossiping algorithm works as follows:

	1. FN receives T, either from a C, or from another FN.
	2. FN checks if T is already in its
