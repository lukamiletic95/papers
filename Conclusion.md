### Conclusion

This paper was focused on improving the Tendermint's algorithm for gossiping transactions from a node's Mempool.

Primarily, we described the general idea behind using blockchain nowadays, explained Tendermint and introduced necessary definitions.

After that, a current solution, along with its drawbacks and advantages was discussed, and three new solutions were provided. Two of those solutions guarantee an outcome but are hard to implement, while the third one is probabilistic  yet easy to implement. Each solution was provided with a pseudocode that represented the idea, along with the illustrations.

In further research, an experimental analysis of the aforementioned algorithms could be conducted, since that will depict the performances discussed herein in a much clearer manner.
