### Trees clustering

As mentioned earlier in the paper, nodes within the system model are not part of a single administrative domain. They are a part of a large scale wide area network, where full connectivity cannot be established. For that reason, a *FN* node can only be connected to a subset of other *FN* nodes, which we denoted as the *peer subset*.
