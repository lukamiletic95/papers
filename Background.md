### Background

In the modern era, which may as well be referred to as the *Data era*, collection of data has virtually become a part of everyday life. Nowadays, when nearly everyone is online, it is only natural that they expect to benefit from it as much as possible. In order for that to happen, various online services collect all sorts of data about their clients, with the goal of providing the highest quality service.

However, most of the information accumulated by different organizations is stored within those very organizations. Ergo, we may state that our private information is a part of a *single point of failure* system, meaning it could easily become compromised.
