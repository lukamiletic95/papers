In this section, before all else, a current algorithm used in Tendermint for gossiping transactions from a node's Mempool is described in a subsection:

* `Current solution` 

Following, analysis of three different algorithms is provided. Each algorithm is supported with a pseudocode which describes its functioning at a high abstraction level. That pseudocode may be used for various implementations. Those three algorithms are:

* `Five state approach`
* `Tree clustering`
* `Push-pull-push HEAP with PSS`
