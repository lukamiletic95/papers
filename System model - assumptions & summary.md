### System model - assumptions & summary

To summarize the complete definition of the system model, in further text all of the assumptions made are listed:
* Full nodes have public IP addresses.
* Validator set is a subset of full nodes set - *n < m*.
* Validator set is a dynamic one - it changes potentially for each block to be added to the blockchain.
* The connection among the nodes in the network is not a full mesh, but a peer-to-peer connection.
