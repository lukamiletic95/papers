### System model

Algorithms described in section four: `Algorithms`, rely on a network model explained here.

* *C - Client node*
* *FN - Full node*
* *V - Validator node*
* *CFG - Configuration file*

Let us consider a client-server architecture that consists of different types of nodes (*C, FN, V, CFG*). In a practical situation, a node may be represented by either a single hardware device or multiple hardware devices. Therefore, this type of model representation allows for a certain level of abstraction that omits hardware details, yet enables a concise discussion without loss of generality.
