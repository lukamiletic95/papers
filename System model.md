* *C - Client node*
* *FN - Full node*
* *V - Validator node*
* *CFG - Configuration file*

Let us consider a client-server architecture that consists of different types of nodes. In a practical situation, a node may be represented by either a single hardware device or multiple hardware devices. Therefore, this type of model representation allows for a certain level of abstraction
