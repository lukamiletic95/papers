### Ideal and restrictive

The solution provided here solves the overhead problem that exists within the current one. It does so by enabling a client transaction to be sent only to nodes that are inside the validator set (only *V* nodes in the current consensus instance will receive the transaction *T*). Be that as it may, it imposes a certain level of restrictiveness, owing to the fact that some additional assumptions have to be made (including the original ones from `System model - assumptions & summary`).

First of all, let us assume that the system now transitions between five states, as shown in *Figure #*.
