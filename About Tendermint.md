### About Tendermint

Tendermint ([1], [5]) is a Byzantine fault-tolerant blockchain. Its consensus algorithm, which is unique due to the fact it does not require mining, is used to order transactions within a blockchain in the presence of malicious actors (Byzantine generals problem - [6]). 

Tendermint consensus algorithm shows that unanimity can be achieved in an unreliable distributed system, under adversarial conditions.

The Tendermint network model is more complex than the one assumed in this paper (`System model - basics`). Apart from *FN* and *V*, it also contains
