### About Tendermint

Tendermint ([1], [5]) is a Byzantine fault-tolerant blockchain. Its consensus algorithm, which is unique due to the fact it does not require mining, is used to order transactions within a blockchain in the presence of malicious actors (Byzantine generals problem - [6]). 

Tendermint consensus algorithm shows that unanimity be achieved in an unreliable distributed system, under adversarial conditions.
