### Gossip communication protocol

We consider the same scenario described in the preceding subsection, only now, the main focus is on describing (in general), how a *C* request is able to reach all of the *S* in the network.

It should be noted that not all servers are connected, therefore, a full-mesh connection is not established within the assumed network. Due to that, for a client's request to reach all of the server, the request must be transferred via some sort of protocol that guarantees that, eventually, the information will reach everyone to whom it is of interest.
